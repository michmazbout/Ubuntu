% If everytime you go in ubuntu and then when you are done and go back to use windows and you see your clock 2 hours behind or just wrong
% Log back into Ubuntu and go to terminal (ctrl+alt+t) and write the following command 

timedatectl set-local-rtc 1 --adjust-system-clock

% After doing that go back to windows and fix the time and now it should no longer become wrong when you switch between ubuntu and windows
